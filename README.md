# JPMG_Quantitative_Research-Virtual-Experience

This repository documents the completion of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program, offered through Forage. The program simulates real-world quantitative research tasks performed by analysts and researchers at JPMorgan Chase & Co., focusing on data analysis, financial modeling, and risk evaluation.

## Task One: Investigate and Analyze Price Data

Objective:
Analyze historical price data to identify trends, seasonality, and make future forecasts.

Solution Approach:
Utilized the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast future price movements.

## Task Two: Price a Commodity Storage Contract

Objective:
Calculate the value of a commodity storage contract based on historical price fluctuations and storage constraints.

Solution Approach:

Modeled the price behavior and storage strategy

Used mathematical techniques to determine the optimal storage and release times

Calculated the present value of the expected contract payoff

## Task Three: Credit Risk Analysis

Objective:
Assess and classify loan applications based on potential credit risk.

Solution Approach:
Applied a Decision Tree Classifier for binary classification:

Preprocessed customer credit data

Built and trained a decision tree to predict default risk

Evaluated performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix

## Task Four: Bucket FICO Scores

Objective:
Segment customers into credit score buckets to optimize risk-based decision making.

Solution Approach:
Used clustering algorithms and dynamic programming to:

Group FICO scores into meaningful segments

Minimize intra-bucket variance while ensuring interpretability

Apply bucket assignments to assist with downstream credit modeling
